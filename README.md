# Description
Necromundus - A small DLC-sized Skyrim mod built using Creation Kit, Papyrus, and C++.

Public/Commercial details will be posted with the nexus post of this mod. Currently Unavailable.

This repo will be a location to save, post, and detail technical information for the project. This project is open for people to
copy or utilize in their own work, although I would appreciate credit.

Current planned features and details:
- A custom faction built on the Vanilla system, implemented via scripts
- A new zone/location the size of ~2 Holds
- Custom Spells
- 2+ Followers, fully voiced and interactable with a custom written follower system
- Several branching story paths and many related side-quests
- New Ambush/Hunting system implemented via scripts, based on new factions
- Integration with several other mods, for example Organic Factions Framework and Skyrim Reptuation

Other goals I would like to fit into this project:
- SKSE plugins for optmizations
- A custom Lighting system, specifically for underground locations
- More global interactions, intra-faction reactions/quest changes/follower changes based on choices made

I want to create a mod that not only provides a well built story and enviroment to sandbox in, but I want to use
this project as a jumping off point to improve skyrims sandboxing experience without impeding on current mods.
Choices and interacitons made in this DLC should impact the world around you, and permenantly alter the way you
and NPC's view the world.
